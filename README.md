# Higher-Lower-Game

Python project simulating the Higher - Lower game. 2 names are selected at random and the player needs to guess which of the 2 have more number of followers on Instagram. The aim of the game is to achieve maximum score as possible. The game ends as soon as the player guesses wrong.

When choosing between A and B, and guessing right, the player now has to choose between B and C. This goes on until the player guesses wrong. For the player's help, a short description of A and B, and the country to which they belong to, are displayed at the start, before guessing.

The data has been included in the game_data.py file, which is a list of disctionaries.
